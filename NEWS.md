# IDF 2.0.0

The package was extended to allow generalized linear modeling of the d-GEV parameters. This can be used to model for example spatial variations of the parameters. 
The packet was extensively revised and restructured and some functions were removed as they were too specific. 


# IDF 1.0.0

R package for maximum likelihood fitting of duration-dependent generalized extreme value distribution (d-GEV). 
Additional functions for processing data (obtaining annual maxima) plotting IDF curves.
